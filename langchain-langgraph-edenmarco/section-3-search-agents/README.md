# Section-3: Search Agents

## Course Useful Packages, Tools Used

- The package manager used here is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), this is similar to `pip` but `uv` is much faster since it is built using Rust.
- [Tavily](https://www.tavily.com/) - 3rd party package which will help our agent to web and provide searching capabilities `uv add langchain-tavily`. It also provides other API's like Extract, Crawl etc.
