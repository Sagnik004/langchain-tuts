# Section-6: The GIST of RAG Embeddings, Vector Databases and, & Retrieval

## Topics Covered

- Embeddings
- Vector Stores (**Pinecone** will be used here)
- RetrievalQA Chain
- [LangChain Document Loaders](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/document_loaders)
- [LangChain Text Splitters](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/integrations/splitters)

## Important Learnings


## Course Useful Packages, Tools Used

- Vector DB used here is [pinecone](https://www.pinecone.io/). And, also a local vector store called [faiss](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) by Meta.
- The package manager used here is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), this is similar to `pip` but `uv` is much faster since it is built using Rust.
- Packages used: `langchain langchain-openai langchain-pinecone langchainhub langchain-community pypdf faiss-cpu python-dotenv black isort`
